# Example avocadoctl configuration file
# This file demonstrates the available configuration options

[avocado.ext]
# Directory where extensions are stored
dir = "/var/lib/avocado/extensions"

# Mutability mode for system extensions - sysext (/usr, /opt)
# Valid values: no, auto, yes, import, ephemeral, ephemeral-import
# Default: ephemeral
sysext_mutable = "ephemeral"

# Mutability mode for configuration extensions - confext (/etc)
# Valid values: no, auto, yes, import, ephemeral, ephemeral-import
# Default: ephemeral
confext_mutable = "ephemeral"

# Legacy option (deprecated, use sysext_mutable and confext_mutable instead)
# If specified, applies to both sysext and confext unless overridden
# mutable = "ephemeral"

# Examples of different configurations:
# sysext_mutable = "no"           # Force immutable mode for /usr, /opt
# confext_mutable = "yes"         # Force mutable mode for /etc, create write routing directories
# sysext_mutable = "auto"         # Enable mutable mode for /usr, /opt if write routing directories present
# confext_mutable = "import"      # Immutable mode for /etc but merge write routing contents
# sysext_mutable = "ephemeral-import" # Mutable mode for /usr, /opt with write routing merged but changes discarded after unmerge
